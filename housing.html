   <h2>Here is a great video about the many different types of type of <a href="https://youtu.be/xrGm21aVHic?si=GXPEKH6VwpE10_N1" target="_blank">homes </a>for your new friend.</h2>
   <p>There are a few things you will want to look for in a cage. Luckily, guinea pigs can't jump over things very easily so often cages look short and don't have a top.  If you have other animals you will want to get something that will protect them however, if this is your only pet, you don't have to have a full enclosure.</p> 

   <p>If you are going to house them inside, you will need to make sure you are cleaning the cage often so your room doesn't start to smell like a barn so you will need to find something that is easy to clean.</p>

   <p>Another thing to look for is something with high enough sides to keep any bedding or hay contained in their cage.  They get the zoomies every once in a while and kick up bedding and hay. </p>

   <p>Lastly, make sure there are lots of things for your guinea pig to chew on.  Their teeth continually grow so they chew on things to keep them at a good length.</p>
